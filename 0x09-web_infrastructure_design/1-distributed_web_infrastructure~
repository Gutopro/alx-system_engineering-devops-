Answer :
Design of Three Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com:

Two Servers:

Server 1: Web Server (Nginx) and Load Balancer (HAproxy)
Server 2: Application Server and Database (MySQL)
Web Server (Nginx):

It will serve as a reverse proxy to redirect incoming requests to the application server.
Nginx is lightweight, scalable, and has good performance.
Application Server:

It will host the application codebase and process the dynamic content of the website.
The application server will handle requests from Nginx and respond with the appropriate data.
Load Balancer (HAproxy):

It will distribute incoming requests across multiple application servers using a Round-Robin algorithm.
Round-Robin distributes requests evenly across servers in a circular fashion.
Active-Active setup is being used in which multiple application servers can process requests simultaneously.
Database (MySQL):

The database will store website data such as user information, product details, etc.
A Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster is being used for high availability and data redundancy.
The Primary node is the primary database server that accepts all write operations and replicates the data to the Replica nodes.
The Replica nodes are read-only servers that replicate data from the Primary node and are used for read operations.
The Replica nodes can take over as the Primary node in case of failure.
Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

There is a single load balancer, which can become a SPOF. If it fails, all incoming requests will be lost.
To mitigate this, we can add a secondary load balancer to create a High Availability setup.
Security Issues:

There is no firewall to protect the servers from external attacks.
HTTPS is not enabled, which can make the website vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
To mitigate these issues, we can add a firewall and enable HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates.
Monitoring:

There is no monitoring system to track server performance and detect failures.
We can use tools such as Nagios or Zabbix to monitor server performance and alert us in case of failures.
